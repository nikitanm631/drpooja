                <p class="text-justify">Pediatric surgery is a consolidation of technological excellence, medical expertise and collaboration among different divisions to deliver the best possible outcomes. We offer a full range of services to our pediatric patients, working closely with our experienced Pediatricintensivists, Pediatric nephrologists, Neonatologist, Pediatric Anesthetist, Peri-operative staff etc. to provide intensive care and a high-quality, safe and emotionally supportive environment. </p>
                <p class="text-justify">We offer consultation and ensure comprehensive inpatient and outpatient surgical care. We have special expertise in dealing with various congenital anomalies requiring complex reconstruction surgeries.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">As a division, pediatric surgery has a competitive edge in managing congenital (problems present since birth), abdominal and thoracic problems. In collaboration with our Pediatric gastroenterologists, we treat many complex conditions like biliary atresia, Hirschsprung`s Disease etc. Our day care facilities for minor surgeries like hernia, hydrocoel, circumcision or undescended testis ensure early discharge within 6-8 hours. Besides we are available round the clock for emergencies like acute appendicitis, gall bladder stones and intestinal obstruction that require immediate attention.</p>
