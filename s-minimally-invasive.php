                <p class="text-justify">Minimally invasive spine surgery, also known as MISS, is any minimally invasive procedure that targets conditions specifically within the spine through the use of small incisions as opposed to traditional open-spine surgery which typically requires a 5-6 inch incision. This technique utilizes modern technology, advanced imaging techniques and special medical equipment to reduce tissue trauma, bleeding, radiation exposure, hospital stays and recovery by minimizing the size of the incision.</p>
