                <p class="text-justify">A cystoscopy is a procedure to look inside your child's urethra and bladder using a cystoscope. A cystoscope is a small tube with a light and magnifying camera on the end. The procedure is used to diagnose and treat conditions of the bladder and urethra. Your child may bleed more than expected or develop an infection.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>Procedure : </b>Your child will be given general anesthesia to keep him or her asleep and pain free during the procedure. The cystoscope will be will be placed through your child's urethra and into his or her bladder. The urologist will look at the walls of your child's urethra as the scope goes through to his or her bladder. Your child's bladder will be filled with liquid so the urologist can see the inside of his or her bladder more clearly. </p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>After-surgery care : </b>You will be able to take your child home after he or she is fully awake. You may see small amounts of blood in your child's urine. This is normal. It is also normal for your child to have an increased need to urinate. Your child may also have burning or mild discomfort in his or her bladder or kidney area during urination.</p>
