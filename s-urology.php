                <p class="text-justify">Pediatric Urology is a sub-speciality of surgery which deals with disorders of the Genitourinary System in children, that includes the kidneys, ureters, bladder, sexual and reproductive organs.Pediatric urological disorders are present in children from birth and are very different from that of adult urological problems. We focus on a wide range of urologic problems affecting children, including obstructions in the urinary tract, incontinence, vesicoureteral reflux, hypospadias, undescended testis, genital abnormalities and tumors of the kidney, bladder, vagina, and testes in children.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">In many cases nowadays, urological problems can be managed successfully without surgery by waiting with careful observation, thus delaying or even avoiding the surgery completely. Advances in technology and instrumentation have made more and more Laparoscopic and Endoscopic urological surgeries possible in children, eliminating many other problems associated with open surgery.</p>
                <p class="text-justify">In cases where there is a need for a surgery, it is performed with great expertise, precision and care, considering the fact that the patient being operated on is a small child. The management of urological problems, if any, in a child can be planned even before the delivery of a child.We work in collaboration with our obstetrician and pediatric nephrologist to ensure that.</p>
