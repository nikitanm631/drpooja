                <p class="text-justify">Laparoscopy surgery uses small cuts to insert a camera and tools into the abdomen to perform a surgical procedure. It can be used for diagnosis and treatment of many gynaecological problems, but not for every problem. Your child will probably not have to stay in hospital as well as not have very much pain after the procedure.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>Procedure : </b>During a colonoscopy a thin flexible tube called a colonoscope is passed into the rectum (the back passage) and guided around the large bowel. The front end of the colonoscope carries a small camera with a light attached which allows the specialist to see the inside of the bowel on a television screen.</p>
                <p class="text-justify"><b>After-surgery care : </b>Children usually recover faster from laparoscopic surgery than from traditional open surgery. Many patients go home the same day as the surgery. Because of the smaller incisions, scars are very small compared to traditional surgery. </p>
